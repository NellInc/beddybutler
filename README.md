# beddybuttler

*** Applet Description ***

Beddy Buttler is a small menu bar app for OSX. It is designed to help you go to bed at a specified time. 

The utility will randomly play a sound sample at random times, between a period of time set by the user, i.e. when they would like to get in the habit of going to bed (e.g. 10:30-11:00).

The applet will nudge you to go to bed during a time frame. 


*** Applet Stories ****

Setup:
You can change the following settings:

- Set a timeframe for your desired time to prepare to go to bed (e.g. 10:30 - 11:00)
- Choose your applet behaviour from a set of butlers: Shy, Insistent and Zombie.
- You may also be able to preview each buttler.
- Configure whether you would like the applet to launch at login (this setting will be ON by default)


*** Features ***


The app main goal is to nudge one to go to bed at the proper time, rather than stay up late on the computer.

The utility will randomly play a sound sample at random times, between a period of time set by the user, i.e. when they would like to get in the habit of going to bed (e.g. 10:30-11:00).

The sound samples are of different 'butlers', kind of like how a butler might clear his throat to alert his master to a situation, but without being intrusive. (The app is currently playing fixed standard sounds from OSX while we work on recording the butler sounds, which will be available in days to comeâ€¦)

The UX features an About, Preferences, and Quit. The Preferences shows compound slider bars for setting the time period for preparing for bed, and 3 radio buttons for 3 different butlers (Shy, Insistent, and Zombie), and a preview button for each. 

The app can auto-open on startup/login if the user activates this option.
