Beddy buttler is a small applet utlity for OSX. It is designed to help you go to bed at a specified time. 

The applet will nudge you to go to bed during a time frame. 


*** Applet Stories ****

Setup:
You can change the following settings:

- Set a timeframe for your desired time to prepare to go to bed (e.g. 10:30 - 11:00)
- Choose your applet behaviour from a set of butlers: Shy, Insistent and Zombie.
- You may also be able to preview each buttler
- Configure whether you would like the applet to launch at login (this setting will be ON by default)

*** DRAFT INFO (original) ***

I would like your help with scripting a small menu applet utility for OSX.

The goal is to make a piece of software that nudges one to go to bed at the proper time, rather than stay up late on the computer (a problem I face myself!)

The utility will randomly play a sound sample at random times, between a period of time set by the user, i.e. when they would like to get in the habit of going to bed (e.g. 10:30-11:00).

The sound samples are of different 'butlers', kind of like how a butler might clear his throat to alert his master to a situation, but without being intrusive. I can provide all sound assets required.

The UX will feature an About, Preferences, and Quit. The Preferences will show slider bars for setting the time period for preparing for bed, and 3 radio buttons for 3 different butlers (Shy, Insistent, and Zombie), and a preview button for each. 

The app will auto-open on startup/login.

It should be possible to encapsulate a script within the following framework to accomplish this:

This is to be a free and open source project targeted primarily at OSX. However, ideally this could also be made cross-platform (Linux/Windows).

Many thanks for your interest in this small and fun project!
